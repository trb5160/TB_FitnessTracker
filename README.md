Tom Barber - Fitness Tracker

Description:  Everyone at some point in their lives desires to get in better shape than they currently am.  To help with this, I created an app that can help one track and plan their exercises.  The app uses node.js and mongoose to store your workouts in a server so you can keep track of what you've done and how long you've done it.  There is also a dashboard feature that allows the user to see the same information in graph form.
